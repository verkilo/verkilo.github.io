    <h1>Permissions Policy</h1>
    <p>With the exception of “guest posts” written by others (see the bottom of this page) and content of other authors duly credited, I own the content on this Web site. It is copyrighted in my name. I want to strike the appropriate balance between getting my content widely distributed while at the same time protecting my intellectual property rights. Thanks in advance for your cooperation.</p>

<h2 id="without-my-permission">Without My Permission</h2>

<p>You are free to do the following without my permission:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Link to my site or any specific post on my site.</li>
  <li>Extract and re-post less than 200 words on any other site, provided you link back to my original post.</li>
  <li>Print off my posts and photocopy up to 50 copies for internal distribution within your own company or organization.</li>
  <li>Print my posts in any non-commercial publication (e.g., company newsletter, church newsletter, class syllabus, etc.), provided you include this copyright notice: “© , Benjamin C. Wilson. All rights reserved. Originally published at <strong>Verkilo</strong>.”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="not-without-my-permission">Not Without My Permission</h2>

<p>You must have my express written consent to do any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use this content in for commercial purposes, including selling or licensing printed or digital versions of my content.</li>
  <li>Alter, transform, or build upon this work.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="re-posting-and-translation-rights">Re-Posting and Translation Rights</h2>

<p>I do not permit the re-posting of my posts in their entirety. This is because Google penalizes websites for publishing duplicate content. It often can’t tell which site hosts the original, so I risk getting penalized myself for granting permission.</p>

<p>In addition, I don’t allow the translation and publication of my work in other languages. I simply don’t have the resources to validate the quality of the work.</p>

<h2 id="guest-posts">Guest Posts</h2>

<p>Guest bloggers retain the copyright to the posts they write. The above permission guidelines do not apply to their work. If you are interested in re-posting or publishing their content, you must contact them directly. I cannot serve as a broker, agent, or contact point.</p>

<p>If you have some use for my content that is not covered here, please email me at <strong>merovex at gmail dot com</strong>.</p>

<p>The above text of this page is <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0)</a></p>

<h2 id="registered-trademark">Registered Trademark</h2>

<p>The Merovex logo (<img src="/assets/logo.svg" width="20px" height="20px" alt="" />®) is a registered trademark owned by the site owner. Only Owner and its authorized licensees may use the Merovex Logo in advertising, promotional, and sales materials. When you are a licensee of this trademark, you: 1) may only use the mark to advertize Merovex, and include an attribution of my ownership of the trademark within the credit notice section of your publication.</p>
