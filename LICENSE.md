With the exception of "guest posts" written by others (see the bottom of this page) and content of other authors duly credited, I own the content on this Web site. It is copyrighted in my name. I want to strike the appropriate balance between getting my content widely distributed while at the same time protecting my intellectual property rights. Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

## Without My Permission

You are free to do the following without my permission:

   * Link to my site or any specific post on my site.
   * Extract and re-post less than 200 words on any other site, provided you link back to my original post.
   * Print off my posts and photocopy up to 50 copies for internal distribution within your own company or organization.
   * Print my posts in any non-commercial publication (e.g., company newsletter, church newsletter, class syllabus, etc.), provided you include this copyright notice: “© {{ now | date: "%Y" }}, Benjamin C. Wilson. All rights reserved. Originally published at **{{site.title}}**.”

## Not Without My Permission

You must have my express written consent to do any of the following:

   * Use this content in for commercial purposes, including selling or licensing printed or digital versions of my content.
   * Alter, transform, or build upon this work.

## Re-Posting and Translation Rights

I do not permit the re-posting of my posts in their entirety. This is because Google penalizes websites for publishing duplicate content. It often can’t tell which site hosts the original, so I risk getting penalized myself for granting permission.

In addition, I don’t allow the translation and publication of my work in other languages. I simply don’t have the resources to validate the quality of the work.

## Guest Posts

Guest bloggers retain the copyright to the posts they write. The above permission guidelines do not apply to their work. If you are interested in re-posting or publishing their content, you must contact them directly. I cannot serve as a broker, agent, or contact point.

If you have some use for my content that is not covered here, please email me at **merovex at gmail dot com**.
