* [Editor Merge](#editor-merge) - incorporate editor feedback from MS Word document.

### Editor Merge

When authors send the document off for editing, they typically do so in MS Word format. However, when they receive the document back, they need to split it back into the original files. This feature helps convert the document back into the many files.

* When the source file is built, each original file is prepended with an H6.
  * The LaTeX subparagraph is removed by macro.
  * The HTML & ePUB H6 is `{display: none}`
  * The MS Word Heading 6 is reduced to font-size 5 and color changes to grey to conceal it.
